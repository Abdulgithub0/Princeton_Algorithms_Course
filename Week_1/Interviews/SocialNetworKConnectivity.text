Question:


1. The problem can be best solved using a Union-Find algorithm, specifically Weighted Quick Union (WQU).
2. The only update needed in Weighted Quick Union occurs in the union method:
   - Step 1:
     - Two variables, A and B, are declared and initialized to 0. A = 0 indicates not all nodes are connected, and B = 0 indicates no two nodes are connected.
   - Step 2:
     - Introduce variable B in the union method, incrementing its value for each call based on the log content stored in M.
     - Assign the value of B to A "if and only if" B == N - 1, where N represents the total number of members.
   - Step 3:
     - The earliest time at which all members are connected will then be:
       - The timestamp corresponding to serial number A, counting from the first timestamp to A timestamp.
